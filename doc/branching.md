We will utilize a feature branch type structure to edit our main repository in order to reduce complexity. Each branch will be named in the following convention: <br>
name_<feature_added> <br><br>
For example: <br>
aidan_pose_estimation <br><br>
The description should include more specifics on what is added or changed in a list format. <br>
Ex: <br>
Adds pose estimation element to Capture Workout page <br>
Fixes 404 bug when exiting Capture Workout page
