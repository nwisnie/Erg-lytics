This directory is used to store manual test documents. These manual tests should follow the template outlined in example.txt also included in
this directory. Include a manual test document to document your manual tests of features before you submit a PR  that adds a critical user
workflow.


Test documents should be named like:
<name>_<date>_<feature>
Ex:
