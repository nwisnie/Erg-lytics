Name of tester: Aidan Mahaffey
Date: 2/8/26
Outcome: Pass
Actual Results/Evidence: Body tracker in the capture workout feature of the erglytics website was able
to track my body movements using keypoint nodes in real time utilizing my laptop camera.

Test Steps: Opened Erglytics website using: https://v353vlxck0.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/
Proceded to make an account and navigate to the homepage. Navigated to the "Capture Workout" page.
Pressed the "Start" button. Allowed webite to access my device's camera. Moved my body back and forth
to test the accuracy and latency of the body tracker. Pressed the "Stop" button. Pressed the "Back"
button.

Next Steps: Seeing as the website is capable of hosting a cv tracking program, we should move onto
improving the current implementation of the model.
